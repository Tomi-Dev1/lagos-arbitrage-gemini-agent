Lagos Arbitrage Agent 🚀
A Gemini 3-powered Logistics Intelligence Tool for Nigerian Markets

🧠 The Gemini Integration
This project leverages Gemini 3 Pro’s Reasoning (Thinking) capabilities to solve the "last-mile profit" problem. Unlike standard price-comparison tools, this agent acts as a trade consultant that:

Processes Long-Context Data: Analyzes a specialized dataset of 1,200+ market entries.

Location-Aware Reasoning: Uses the user's live GPS coordinates to calculate haulage costs (₦500/km) from 5 major Lagos hubs (Alaba, Mile 12, Computer Village, etc.).

Decision Logic: Determines "True Net Profit" by subtracting logistics fees and weighing the risk of distance against potential gain.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Model: Gemini 3 Pro / Flash (Google AI Studio)

Dataset: 1,200+ rows of curated Lagos market vs. Online price data.

Frontend: React / Tailwind CSS (Deployed via Cloud Run/AI Studio).

APIs: Browser Geolocation API for real-time logistics tracking.

🚀 Key Features
Smart Search: Instant filtering of 1.2k assets with zero-lag UI.

Logistics Engine: Dynamic delivery fee calculation based on proximity to Mile 12, Alaba, or Ikeja.
